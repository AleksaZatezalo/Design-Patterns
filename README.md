## Contributing
Before contributing read through the contribution guidlines found the CONTRIBUTING file.

### Code Style
A few key points when contributing to this repo are as follows:

    Use tabs over spaces.
    Each function must contain a doc strings formated as such:
    
    /**
    * DESCRIPTION
    *
    * PARAM 1: DESCRIPTION
    * PARAM 2: DESCRIPTION
    * PARAM 3: DESCRIPTION
    * ...
    * PARAM N: DESCRIPTION 
    */
    
    Do not add spaces between docstring and first function line.
    Do not go over 200 characters per line.
    When closing multiline items under brackets('()', '[]', ... etc) put the closing bracket on it's own line.

All files you choose to include in a PR must include a description, your name, date of creation, and a version number at the beggining of the class as follows:

/**
* The HelloWorld program implements an application that
* simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
*
* @author Aleksa
* @version 1.0
* @since   2014-03-31 
*/
